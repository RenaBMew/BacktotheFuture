                    From Academy Award®-winning filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Robert
                    Zemeckis comes Back to the Future — the original, ground-breaking
                    adventure that sparked one of the most successful trilogies ever.
                </p>
                <p class="art__p3-p">
                    In this 1980s sci-fi classic, small-town California teen Marty McFly
                    (Michael J. Fox) is thrown back into the '50s in a time-traveling
                    DeLorean invented by his eccentric friend Doc Brown. He must find a
                    way to get back to the present and make sure his parents fall in
                    love or risk erasing his own existence. Along the way, Marty must
                    also navigate the different social norms and technologies of the
                    past while avoiding the wrath of the town bully, Biff. Eventually,
                    with the help of Doc Brown and his own resourcefulness, Marty is
                    able to set things right and return to the present, but not before
                    setting up the stage for the sequels to come.

                <p class="art__p3-p">
                    In the United States (U.S.) and Canada, Back to the Future received
                    a wide release on July 3, 1985, ahead of the Independence Day
                    holiday weekend. The film earned $3.6 million during the opening
                    Wednesday and Thursday, and a further $11.3 million during its
                    inaugural weekend from 1,420 theaters – an average of $7,853 per
                    theater. Recalling the opening weeks, Gale said, "our second weekend
                    was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great word
                    of mouth." In total, Back to the Future was the number one film for
                    eleven of its twelve first weeks and remained in the top ten
                    highest-grossing films for a total of twenty-four. By the end of its
                    theatrical run, Back to the Future earned an approximate box office
                    gross of $210.6 million.
                </p>

                <p class="art__p3-p">
                    Outside the United States and Canada, the film earned a further
                    estimated $170.5 million. Cumulatively, Back to the Future earned a
                    worldwide gross of $381.1 million, making it the highest-grossing
                    film of 1985, ahead of Rocky IV ($300.5 million) and Rambo: First
                    Blood Part II ($300.4 million).Back to the Future has received
                    several theatrical re-releases to celebrate anniversaries, including
                    a remastered version screened in 2010. These releases have raised
                    the film's worldwide total to $388.8 million.

                <h2>Movie Stills</h2>
                <p class="art__p3-p">
                    The on-set production process and filming of "Back to the Future"
                    was a complex and demanding undertaking that required the
                    coordination of numerous departments and crew members. The film was
                    shot on location in California and on several sound stages at the
                    Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <p class="art__p3-p">
                    One of the biggest challenges faced by the filmmakers was the
                    creation of the film's time-traveling DeLorean car. The production
                    team worked closely with automotive experts to modify the vehicle
                    and give it the iconic look that would become a hallmark of the film
                    franchise. Special effects were also used extensively to create the
                    illusion of time travel and other fantastical elements of the story.
                </p>
                <p class="art__p3-p">
                    The filming of "Back to the Future" also required a great deal of
                    planning and logistical coordination. Scenes were shot out of order
                    and on different sets, and the crew had to coordinate lighting,
                    sound, and camera movements to ensure that everything would fit
                    together seamlessly in the final cut. Multiple takes were often
                    required to capture the perfect shot, and many scenes had to be
                    re-shot or tweaked in post-production to achieve the desired effect.
