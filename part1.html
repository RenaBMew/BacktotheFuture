          <h1>Synopsis</h1>
          <p class="art__p3-p">
            From Academy Award®-winning filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Robert
            Zemeckis comes Back to the Future — the original, ground-breaking
            adventure that sparked one of the most successful trilogies ever.
          </p>

          <p class="art__p3-p">
            In this 1980s sci-fi classic, small-town California teen Marty McFly
            (Michael J. Fox) is thrown back into the '50s in a time-traveling
            DeLorean invented by his eccentric friend Doc Brown. He must find a
            way to get back to the present and make sure his parents fall in
            love or risk erasing his own existence. Along the way, Marty must
            also navigate the different social norms and technologies of the
            past while avoiding the wrath of the town bully, Biff. Eventually,
            with the help of Doc Brown and his own resourcefulness, Marty is
            able to set things right and return to the present, but not before
            setting up the stage for the sequels to come.
          </p>

          <p class="art__p3-p">
            In the United States (U.S.) and Canada, Back to the Future received
            a wide release on July 3, 1985, ahead of the Independence Day
            holiday weekend. The film earned $3.6 million during the opening
            Wednesday and Thursday, and a further $11.3 million during its
            inaugural weekend from 1,420 theaters – an average of $7,853 per
            theater. Recalling the opening weeks, Gale said, "our second weekend
            was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great word
            of mouth." In total, Back to the Future was the number one film for
            eleven of its twelve first weeks and remained in the top ten
            highest-grossing films for a total of twenty-four. By the end of its
            theatrical run, Back to the Future earned an approximate box office
            gross of $210.6 million.
          </p>

          <p class="art__p3-p">
            Outside the United States and Canada, the film earned a further
            estimated $170.5 million. Cumulatively, Back to the Future earned a
            worldwide gross of $381.1 million, making it the highest-grossing
            film of 1985, ahead of Rocky IV ($300.5 million) and Rambo: First
            Blood Part II ($300.4 million).Back to the Future has received
            several theatrical re-releases to celebrate anniversaries, including
            a remastered version screened in 2010. These releases have raised
            the film's worldwide total to $388.8 million.

          <h2>Movie Stills</h2>
          <p class="art__p3-p">
            The on-set production process and filming of "Back to the Future"
            was a complex and demanding undertaking that required the
            coordination of numerous departments and crew members. The film was
            shot on location in California and on several sound stages at the
            Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p class="art__p3-p">
            One of the biggest challenges faced by the filmmakers was the
            creation of the film's time-traveling DeLorean car. The production
            team worked closely with automotive experts to modify the vehicle
            and give it the iconic look that would become a hallmark of the film
            franchise. Special effects were also used extensively to create the
            illusion of time travel and other fantastical elements of the story.
          </p>

          <p class="art__p3-p">
            The filming of "Back to the Future" also required a great deal of
            planning and logistical coordination. Scenes were shot out of order
            and on different sets, and the crew had to coordinate lighting,
            sound, and camera movements to ensure that everything would fit
            together seamlessly in the final cut. Multiple takes were often
            required to capture the perfect shot, and many scenes had to be
            re-shot or tweaked in post-production to achieve the desired effect.
